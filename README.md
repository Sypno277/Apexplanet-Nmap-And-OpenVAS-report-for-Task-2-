## 🧠 About

Each folder represents a separate vulnerability assessment engagement. It includes:

* Nmap and OpenVAS scan results
* Key findings with severity levels
* Evidence and screenshots
* Recommended fixes and re-scan notes

## 🧰 Tools Used

* **Nmap** – for port scanning, service detection, and network mapping
* **OpenVAS (GVM)** – for detailed vulnerability analysis and reporting

## 🧾 Example Workflow

1. Run Nmap scan and export results:

   ```bash
   nmap -sS -sV -T4 -oA nmap-scan 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
2. Perform OpenVAS scan and export the report as `.html` or `.xml`
3. Summarize findings in `reports/summary.md`
4. Commit and push your updates to the repo

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All scans and reports are conducted **only on authorized systems** for **educational and ethical purposes**. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation of networks is illegal and strictly prohibited.

## 📚 Purpose

* To document vulnerability assessments
* To learn and improve network security analysis skills
* To maintain a personal record of ethical cybersecurity research
